        I'm Stephen Greco -- a software engineer with 12+ years of experience
        building front-end applications, design systems, and testing
        infrastructure at scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently a Senior Software Engineer at Stratfield Consulting. Previously
        spent over a decade at United States Steel Corporation, where I grew from
        co-op to Senior Engineer & Tech Lead, leading front-end architecture and
        mentoring engineering teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write about Design Systems, AI, and the craft of building software --
        the things I think about day to day as an engineer.
